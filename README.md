Haxe-c++ bindings for OpenGL 3.3+ and GLFW 2.7.8

This is incredibly early alpha I suppose, I am not at this time intending myself to fully
support the entirety of the API, and the API that is supported will not have been
thoroughly tested if at all.

Anyone wishing to use OpenGL in hxcpp (without any other dependancy, or else use NME!)
should consider testing and submitting pull requests :)
